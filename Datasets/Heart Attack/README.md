## Data Description
This dataset provides information about heart attach patients, there are 14 columns presented in the data of which 13 holding integer values on patient characteristics, clinical measurement or comorbidites and one decimal values providing details on old peak.

Following is the detailed description of the variables included in the dataset:

* age: Age of the person
* sex	Gender of the person: 1 = yes; 0 = no
* cp	Chest Pain type chest pain type:  Value 1: typical angina | Value 2: atypical angina | Value 3: non-anginal pain | Value 4: asymptomatic

* chol	cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
* fbs	(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
* restecg	resting electrocardiographic results: Value 0: normal | Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) | Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
* thalachh	maximum heart rate achieved: target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
* exng	exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* oldpeak	Previous peak
